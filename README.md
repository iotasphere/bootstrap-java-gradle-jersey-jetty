# Bootstrap for Java, Gradle, Jersey, and Jetty

This project contains a shell script that spins up a bootstrapped Java, Gradle, Jersey, Jetty hello world server. It's done generically so you can name your base resource package and project names.

Dependencies: Java, Gradle, a bash shell, and a developer.

Usage:


```shell
$ sh ./java-hello-world-creator.sh

```
You'll be prompted to enter a project name and default resource package name. Once entered, the script handles all of the path and file generation and will spin up a Jetty server. Access the default endpoint here:

__http://localhost:8080/{projectName}/rest/greeting__

Expected response:

__Hello world!__

Happy coding!
